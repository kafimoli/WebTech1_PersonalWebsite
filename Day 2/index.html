    <p>This is an in depth guide to how our trilune goddess Columbina works. </p>

    <h2>Talents</h2>
    <h3>Normal Attack: Moondew Cascade </h3>
    <p><strong>Normal Attack</strong><br>
        Columbina summons Moonlit Tides Performing up to 3 attacks that deal hydro damage </p>

    <p><strong>Charged Attack</strong><br>
        Columbina consumes stamina to deal hydro damage. If you have at least 1 Verdant Dew, Columbina will perform a special charged attack <strong>Moonlight Cleanse</strong>, which will not consume stamina and deal <strong>AoE Lunar-Bloom Damage</strong></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><strong>Gameplay Notes</strong><br>
        <strong>Verdant Dew</strong> is created through Lunar-Bloom reaction
    <br>
        You can use Columbina's special Charged Attack if you want to use her on field, but make sure to have another dendro character to generate <strong>Verdant Dews</strong></p>

    <p></p>

    <h3>Elemental Skill: Eternal Tides</h3>
    <p>When Columbina uses her skill, it will deal AoE Hydro Damage to the surrounding enemies and summoning <strong>Gravity Ripple</strong></p>
    
    <p>When <strong>Gravity Ripple</strong> is on the field, triggering Lunar Reactions will fill this Gravity Ripple and once it is full, it will do <strong>Gravity Interference</strong> that will deal damage to enemies based on the most triggered lunar reaction</p>
    
    <p><strong>Moonsign: Ascendant Gleam: Gravity Ripple</strong> has a wider AoE area</p>
    
    <p><strong>Gameplay Notes</strong><br>
        Columbina's off field damage will mostly come from her Elemental Skill</p>

    <p></p>

    <h3>Elemental Burst: Moonlit Melancholy</h3>
    <p>Columbina temporarily transforms the surrounding terrain into <strong>Lunar Domain</strong>, dealing AoE Hydro Damage and boosting party's Lunar Reaction Damage Bonus</p>
    
    <p><strong>Gameplay Notes</strong><br>
        Columbina's Burst is important as it can boost the entire party's damage</p>

    <p></p>

    <h3>Ascension Passive 1: Lunacy's Lure</h3>
    <p>When triggering <strong>Gravity Interference from Elemental Skill</strong>, she will gain 5% Crit rate for 10s. This effect can be stacked up to 3 times</p>

    <p></p>

    <h3>Ascension Passive 4: Law of the New Moon</h3>
    <p>When Characters are in <strong>Lunar Domain</strong> trigger Lunar Reactions, each lunar reactions will be enhanced</p>

    <p></p>

    <h3>Moonsign Benediction Passive: Moonlight, Lent unto you</h3>
    <p>When party member triggers an electro-charged, bloom, or hydro crystallize, it will be converted into its lunar variants. <br>Lunar Base Damage of party members will be increased by 0.2% for every 1000 HP of Columbina's Max HP, up to 7%</p>
    <p><strong>Gameplay Notes</strong><br>
        To maximize this passive, Columbina will need at least 35000 Max HP to achieve the 7% Lunar base dmg bonus</p>

    <p></p>

    <h3>Talent Priority</h3>
    <p><strong>Elemental Skill = Elemental Burst > Normal Attacks (Upgrade if onfield dps)</strong></p>

    <h2>Weapons</h2>

    <p>This is Columbina's Signature weapon as it gives her a lot of Crit Damage and energy alleviating her energy requirement</p>
    
    <h3>Prototype Amber</h3>
    <p>It is her best free to play weapon as it gives her HP and energy</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Artifacts</h2>
    <h3>Aubade of Morningstar and Moon</h3>
    <p>This is her best artifact set if you're using her as subdps as this set gives elemental mastery and 60% lunar reaction damage bonus</p>

    <h3>Night of the Sky's Unveiling</h3>
    <p>This is her best artifact set if you're using her on field as this set gives a ton of crit rate when triggering lunar reactions</p>
